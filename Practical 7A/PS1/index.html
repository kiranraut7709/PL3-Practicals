        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian
                international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to
                2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World
                Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.
                A right-handed explosive middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers
                in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective
                "finisher" in limited-overs formats. He is widely regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper
                batsman and captain in the history of the game. He was also the first wicket-keeper to
                effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December, 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later
                against Sri Lanka. He has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year
                award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in
                2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's
                third highest civilian honour, in 2018. Dhoni was named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in
                2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as
                captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel to Dhoni on 1
                November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an Indian captain in ODIs and
                T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from
                Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New
                Zealand. In June 2013, when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in England,
                Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup, Champions Trophy
                and the World Twenty20). After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in
                New Zealand and the West Indies, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni
                also led the Indian team to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013, under Dhoni's captaincy, India became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash
                Australia in a Test series. In the Indian Premier League, he captained the Chennai Super Kings to
                victory at the 2010, 2011 and 2018 seasons, along with wins in the 2010 and 2014 editions of Champions
                League Twenty20. In 2011, Time magazine included Dhoni in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most
                Influential People in the World." Dhoni holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd.,
                after resigning from Air India. India Cements is the owner of the Indian Premier League team Chennai
                Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first IPL season. He announced his
                retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2012, SportsPro rated Dhoni as the sixteenth most marketable athlete in the world. He is the
                co-owner of Indian Super League team Chennaiyin FC. In June 2015, Forbes ranked Dhoni at 23rd in the
                list of highest paid athletes in the world, estimating his earnings at US$31 million. In 2016, a
                biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made on his life and his cricket career up to the Indian team's
                win at the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

            <h2>World Cup</h2>
            <p>
                Dhoni has captained India in two World Cups. Under his captaincy, India won the World Cup in 2011 and
                reached the semifinals in 2015.
            </p>
            <h3>2007 Cricket World Cup</h3>
            <p>
                Dhoni played his first ODI World Cup in 2007 in the Caribbean. India made an early exit from the
                tournament in the Group Stage. In 2007 Cricket World Cup, India was placed in Group B with Sri Lanka,
                Bangladesh and Bermuda. Rahul Dravid captained the team in this World Cup. In three matches India
                played, they managed to win only one against Bermuda while losing the rest from Bangladesh and Sri
                Lanka. In their first match against Bangladesh, India was all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs. Dhoni was
                out for 0. He stumped Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan and captain Habibul Bashar in the match but, India
                lost by 5 wickets. In the next match against Bermuda, India posted the then Highest Score in the World
                Cup 413/5 in a must-win match. Dhoni scored 29 off 25 Balls which includes Two 4s and One 6. India won
                the match by 257 runs. India was required to win their last group match against the Lankans, but they
                lost by 69 runs. Chasing the target of 255, India crumbled to 185 all out in 43.3 overs. Dhoni was
                dismissed for 0 for the second time in the tournament, off his first ball by Muttiah Muralitharan. Thus,
                India was out of the world cup in the first round. The Team was heavily criticized for its performance.
                Dhoni's under-construction house in Ranchi was attacked by some 200 fans after the Bangladesh loss.
            </p>
            <h3>2011 Cricket World Cup</h3>
            <p>
                Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. In the final against Sri Lanka, chasing 275,
                Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before an in-form Yuvraj Singh. When he came to bat,
                India needed more than six runs per over with three top-order batsmen already dismissed. He started
                building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir. Due to good strokeplay and active running between
                wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls but later accelerated
                with a greater frequency of boundaries, ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. Befitting the occasion, he
                finished the match off in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won the Man
                of the Match award. Later in the post-match presentation, he admitted that he came up the order so as to
                counter the Muralitharan spin threat, as he was very familiar with Murali's bowling, who was his
                teammate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings. He had come after the
                dismissal of Virat Kohli, also a right-handed batsman. By partnering with the left-handed Gambhir, he
                ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a
                rhythm.
                The bat used by Dhoni in the final match was sold for â‚¹ 72 Lac. The money goes to Sakshi Rawat
                Foundation, operated by Dhoni's wife Sakshi Rawat to help orphan children
            </p>
            <h3>2015 Cricket World Cup</h3>
            <p>
                For the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, Dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member
                squad by the BCCI in December 2014. Under his captaincy, India was able to go through to the
                semi-finals with ease, beating Bangladesh in the quarter-finals. However, they lost to host Australia in
                the semi-finals held at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The team won 7 consecutive matches in this world cup
                and won 11 consecutive matches overall in world cups. With the win against Bangladesh, he became the
                first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches, and the first Indian captain to achieve the mark.
                He is also the third captain to win 100 matches, after two Australians, Ricky Ponting, and Allan Border.
            </p>
            <h3>2019 Cricket World Cup</h3>
            <p>
                Dhoni was named in the 15 man squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup held in England and Wales. Dhoni
                scored some handy knocks in the tournament against South Africa, Australia, and West Indies, although he
                was criticised for his strike rate and 'lack of intent' in the match against Afghanistan and England. In
                the semi-final against New Zealand, Dhoni scored a fighting half-century in the second innings but was
                unfortunately run out at a crucial stage thus ending India's World Cup run.
