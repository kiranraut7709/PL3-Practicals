      <h3>MS Dhoni ‚Äì An Inspiration to Many</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone knows how popular cricket is in India. And in the last
        decade, the cricketer who has received the most love from all over the
        world including India is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Today, who does not
        know Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a good cricketer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a captain has taken Team India to a different
        level. This is the reason why India has consistently occupied the
        largest trophies since last decade.
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="images/Dhoni.jpg" alt="Dhoni" /> <br />
      <p>
        <strong>
          His journey marks from being a simple small town boy to the man who
          led a team to victories in the all three ICC trophies.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Inspirational Start</h3>
      <p>
        There was once a time when the Indian Cricket Team was simply filled
        with the city kids. Due to excellent infrastructure and good scope for
        the game in cities, many small town boys would not succeed defeating
        them in the Ranji Trophy. But this man proved it all wrong. MSD had
        seen a dream, which many feared to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hailing from a very small town of Ranchi, Dhoni dared to dream and
        with courage and guts make that dream a reality. Since a very young
        age, he idolized Sachin Tendulkar who is known as the God of Cricket
        and Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan. He started his career as a
        Ticket Collector in Indian Railways. His hard work and never-give-up
        spirit finally landed him in International Cricket in 2003.
      </p>
      <h3>Becoming a Sensation and Captaincy</h3>
      <p>
        Dhoni was not only known for his cricket but was also very popular for
        his lengthy wavy hair style. In fact, it had then become a trend that
        every boy in the country now wanted to adorn the ‚ÄúDhoni Hairstyle‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dhoni started making rounds for his cool attitude ‚Äì something we all
        most aspire to emulate. We would find him with a smile even in the
        toughest of games. This calm attitude of his landed him as the Captain
        of the team. He had not only made his dream of playing alongside his
        idol Sachin a reality but had become his captain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Under Dhoni‚Äôs captaincy, the Indian cricket team has captured all
          three ICC trophies and Dhoni is the only captain in the world who
          has done this feat. He continues to inspire the younger generation
          with his brilliant captaincy, and out of the box thinking.
        </strong>
