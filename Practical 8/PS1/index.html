        We have not yet found all the large, potentially hazardous near-Earth
        objects, as highlighted by the recent discovery of a kilometer-size
        asteroid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amateur astronomer Leonardo Amaral was scanning the skies on the night
        of August 27th, imaging a region in the constellation Indus, when he
        picked up a cosmic interloper: the asteroid 2020 QU6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amaral used the 0.3-meter reflector at the Campo dos Amarais
        observatory near Sau Paulo, Brazil. The observatory had received a
        recent upgrade thanks to a Planetary Society grant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turns out, 2020 QU6 is about a kilometer across — a surprising find
        given that most such large objects have been found and cataloged. The
        asteroid orbits the Sun once every 3.26 years on an orbit inclined
        23.5° relative to the ecliptic plane. It poses no current threat to
        Earth, having passed within 40 million kilometers (24 million miles,
        more than 100 times the Earth-Moon distance) on September 10th. That's
        the closest the asteroid will come to Earth in the 21st century.

      <h2>PLANETARY SOCIETY GRANT</h2>
      <p>
        The discovery was made possible thanks to an $8,500 grant from the
        Planetary Society's Shoemaker NEO Grant program, which encourages
        advanced amateurs to hunt for new asteroids, as well as to track known
        asteroids and refine their future paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        The grant enabled Amaral and the Campo dos Amarais observatory to
        upgrade to a more stable telescope mount, allowing for more precise
        tracking over longer periods of time. Amaral’s Southern Hemisphere
        vantage point also gave him an edge, as the southern sky is only
        sparsely covered by automated surveys.

      <h2>NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS IN THE NEWS</h2>
      <p>
        Near-Earth asteroids have been in the news a lot recently: On August
        15th, asteroid 2020 QG passed just 2,950 km from Earth's surface, the
        closest a passing asteroid has come. Another asteroid, 2011 ES4 passed
        1.48 million km from Earth on September 2nd and was recovered by the
        PanSTARRS survey, allowing astronomer Gianluca Masi to track the
        asteroid on September 6th.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We hear more and more frequently about asteroid discoveries primarily
        because we are getting better at finding and tracking near-Earth
        asteroids,” says Bruce Betts (Planetary Society) in a recent press
        release. “There aren’t suddenly more asteroids, we’re just getting
        better at seeing them.”

      <h2>NASA'S MANDATE</h2>
      <p>
        Detecting hazardous space rocks in the inner solar system is of
        paramount importance, should we ever have to move one out of the way.
        In 1998, U.S. Congress asked NASA to identify 90% of near-Earth
        asteroids that are 1 kilometer in size and larger. NASA has met that
        goal, though Amaral's observations shows that there are still
        discoveries to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collision with a kilometer-size asteroid would have disastrous effects
        for the globe, but even smaller ones can cause regional damage. For
        that reason, Congress expanded the criterion in 2005, asking that NASA
        find near-Earth objects 140 meters and larger by 2020. We’re well
        behind that goal, with only an estimated 40% of the population
        discovered to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        One NASA effort, the Near Earth Object Surveillance Mission (NEOSM,
        formerly NEOCam) could meet that goal in a decade. If funded, NEOSM
        would launch in the 2025 time-frame. NASA currently spends $160
        million a year on planetary defense, less than 1% of its total annual
        budget.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
        “This discovery reminds us that even though we’ve found most large
        NEOs, we haven’t found all of them,” says Casey Dreier (Planetary
        Society) in a recent press release. “We must continue to support
        ground-based astronomers and invest in new space-based capabilities
        like NEOSM in order to protect Earth now and in the future.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The discovery shows that large, undiscovered space rocks are still out
        there — and that amateur observers can still make meaningful
        contributions to find them.
